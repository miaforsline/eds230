Run Solar Model with Data

```{r solar}
source(here::here("R", "solarpv.R"))
solarpv

# read in R formatted data
load(here::here("data", "sierraczosolar.rda"))

# already in the format required for the model
head(sierraczosolar)
```


```{r solar}
# run the model
solarpv(area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W")

# run and save results - but don't plot
site1 = solarpv(area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W", g=FALSE)
site1$mean
site1$annual

# consider a different pv array that only uses 
# diffuse and has non standard efficiency (0.6)
site2 = solarpv(area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W", g=FALSE, eff=0.6, etype="direct")
site2$mean

```

Informal Sensitivity Analysis

```{r sen1, eval=T}
# lets try informal sensitivity analysis again, this time by varying efficiency if we don't know efficiency exactly , lets try 20 samples

# use map from purrr
# notice how map adds the one parameter that is missing from the input list
eff = rnorm(mean=0.6, sd = 0.1, n=20)
site2 = eff %>% map(~solarpv( area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", eunit="W", g=FALSE, etype="direct", eff=.x ))

head(site2)
```


```{r sen1, eval=T}
# this is pretty messy - but we can extract a useful data structure,lets say we want 
# just the annual data (not the mean annual time series), and then reformat as a data frame with nice column names
tmp = map_df(site2,`[`, c("annual")) 

site2df = data.frame(year = tmp$annual$year, elect= tmp$annual$elect)
#we want the year and electricity as columns 

# now we could plot
ggplot(site2df, aes(year,elect, group=year ))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Electricity generated in W")

# we also might want an average across parameter uncertainty
site2_average = site2df %>% group_by(year) %>% dplyr::summarize(elect=mean(elect))

# now add this to the plot - note that we remove the grouping by using group=1
ggplot(site2df, aes(year,elect, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Electricity in W")+
  geom_line(data=site2_average, aes(year, elect, group=1), col="orange")

# we could also plot how the mean annual electricity varies with efficiency (eff from above)
site2[[1]]

tmp = map_df(site2,`[`, c("mean")) 

# how variable is electricity generation (mean over all time) with uncertainty in solar efficiency

site2_mean = data.frame(eff=eff, elect= tmp)
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(y=mean))+geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x="Electricity in W")

# or to see what the sensitivity looks like
ggplot(site2_mean, aes(eff, mean))+geom_point()+
  labs(y="Electricity in W", x="Solar Efficiency")

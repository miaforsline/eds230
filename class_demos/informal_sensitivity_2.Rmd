# Sensitivity Analysis with *ethresh*

* Assume +-15% uncertainty in *ethresh* parameter

* Default value from the function is 10,000

* Code so that its easy to change

```{r ethresh}
# lets try sensitivity analysis again, 
# ethresh - is defaulted to 10000; lets try +- 15%
# lets try 20 samples from a uniform distribution 
# assume a uniform distribution - we don't know anything about variation

deviation = 0.15 #deviate 15% from the threshold where the max is 15% higher and the min is 15% lower 
base_thresh = 10000

ethresh = runif(min=base_thresh-deviation*base_thresh, 
                max = base_thresh+deviation*base_thresh, n=20)

# now run our model for the parameters
site2 = ethresh %>% map(~solarpv( area=0.1, 
                      solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green", 
                      eunit="W", g=FALSE, etype="direct", 
                      ethresh=.x ))


# extract a useful data structure,lets say we want just the annual data (not the mean), and then reformat as a data frame with nice column names
tmp = map_df(site2,`[`, c("annual")) 
site2df = data.frame(year = tmp$annual$year, 
                     elect= tmp$annual$elect)

# now we could plot
ggplot(site2df, 
       aes(as.factor(year),elect, group=year))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(y="Electricity generated in W", x="Year")
```


```{r ethresh}
# we also might want to see mean electricity generation across parameter uncertainty

mean_elect = map_df(site2,`[`, c("mean")) 
# because there is only 1 value for each ethresh we can add as a column
mean_elect$ethresh = ethresh
# add the efficiency
p1 = ggplot(mean_elect, aes(mean))+geom_histogram()+labs(x="Mean Annual Electricity W")
p1

p2 = ggplot(mean_elect, aes(ethresh, mean))+geom_point(cex=2, col="orange")+labs(y="Mean Annual Electricity W", x="Threshold Radiation (kJ/m2)  \nabove which energy production is more efficient")

# Combined sensivitivity analysis

* *eff*

* *ethresh*

Sample from both of them - each time we run the model we vary
both of the parameters



# Combined parameter sensitivity

- eff + ethresh --> sample from both of them where each time we run the model, we vary both of the parameters 

Two possible approaches

* 1. *for*  
* 2. *pmap* from `purrr`

# 1. Using *pmap* from `purrr`

```{r secondsensitivity}
#set parameters 
# generate samples for both parameters
nsamples = 300
deviation = 0.15
base_thresh = 10000

#sample a uniform distribution from the e-threshold 
ethresh = runif(min=base_thresh-deviation*base_thresh,
                max = base_thresh+deviation*base_thresh, n=nsamples)

eff = rnorm(mean=0.6, sd = 0.1, n=nsamples)

#bind ethresh + eff together as columns 
#parms = parameters = column for efficiency + column for e-threshold 
#300 rows for the 300 samples 
parms = cbind.data.frame(eff, ethresh)

#we will vary both parameters at the same time in case there are interactions
```


```{r secondsensitivity}
# use pmap 
# takes function name and then names of all parameters that don't change
#for each row in parms, it will vary each parameter 
#col names in parm must match the parameters in the solarpv function 
results = parms %>% pmap(solarpv,  area=0.1, 
                         solar=sierraczosolar, clr="green",
                         eunit="W", g=FALSE, etype="direct")

results[[1]]
length(results) #300 results for each parameter set for each sample 
```


```{r secondsensitivity}
# now we can extract results from the list as above
mean_elect = map_df(results,`[`, c("mean")) 

# and we can add the parameter values for each run so we know what parameters gave us which mean value 
mean_elect = cbind.data.frame(mean_elect, parms)
```


```{r secondsensitivity}
# plot - pick on of the 2 parameter as a color

p1 = ggplot(mean_elect, aes(ethresh, mean, col=eff))+geom_point(cex=2)+
  labs(y="Mean Annual Electricity W", x="Threshold Radiation (kJ/m2)  \n above which energy production is more efficient")
p2 = ggplot(mean_elect, aes(eff, mean, col=ethresh))+geom_point(cex=2)+
  labs(y="Mean Annual Electricity W", x="Efficiency")

ggarrange(p1,p2)
```

## What did we learn from the plots? 
Our uncertainty in efficiency is more problematic because it has a bigger effect on our result. Efficiency (`eff`) is more important than the threshold radiation (`ethresh`). 

```{r secondsensitivity}
# extract annual 
tmp = map_df(results,`[`, c("annual")) 
annual_elect = as.data.frame(tmp$annual$year)
colnames(annual_elect)="year"
annual_elect$elect = tmp$annual$elect


```


# 2. Using a *For* Loop
```{r}
# using a for loop
# start by creating a data structures to hold results from the for loop, separate 
# for scenario mean and annual values

mean_elect_for = rep(NA, times=nsamples) #initialize the data structure 

# for annual we need rows as years, columns for samples
years = unique(sierraczosolar$year) #we need to know how many years there are 

#initialize a dataframe
annual_elect_for = as.data.frame(matrix(ncol=nsamples, nrow=length(years)))
annual_elect_for$year=years
```


```{r}
#for each i, we will use the solarpv function and loop through each ethresh + eff value 
for (i in 1:nsamples) {
  res = solarpv( area=0.1, solar=sierraczosolar,
                 clr="green", eunit="W", g=FALSE, etype="direct",
                 ethresh=parms$ethresh[i],
                 eff = parms$eff[i])
  
  annual_elect_for[,i] = res$annual$elect #save to the i-th col 
  mean_elect_for[i]= res$mean
}
```


```{r}
# plot
me = cbind.data.frame(mean=mean_elect_for, parms)

ggplot(me, aes(eff, mean, col=ethresh))+geom_point(cex=2)+
  labs(y="Mean Annual Electricity W", x="Efficiency")
#again, efficiency is strongly correlated with mean annual electricity 
```


```{r}
tmp = annual_elect_for %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=-c(year)) #take each col and put it as a value and remember the year, so we have 300 rows 

ggplot(tmp, aes(as.factor(year), value))+
  geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Mean Annual Electricity W", x="Year")


```

# Building models with blocks - functions that call other functions

Functions can always embed other functions - and in models the output of one model may be the input to another

* loosely coupled models - output from one becomes input the other - but not necessarily automatic
* fully coupled - models exchange input sna outputs (feedback systems)

Develop a conceptual model

```{r  out.width="75%", out.height="75%", echo=FALSE }
library(knitr)
#include_graphics("../img/power_comparison_figure.jpeg",) 
```

# 

To start - lets create what we need to compute net present value of power generated for multiple years 

* compute_profit_frompower.R

We will use output from our solarpv function as input into a function that estimates profit given a price - and also 'calls' another function to compute net present value

* compute_NPV 
    * inputs: value, time, discount rate
    
    * output  net present value of input value provide as some time in the future

* compute_profit_frompower
    
    * inputs: energy, year (energy was produced in) price, discount rate
    * outputs: single dataframe with columns for
                    * energy
                    * year
                    * net (profit from energy in that year)
                    * netpre (net present value of that profit)

```{r valuep}
source(here::here("R", "compute_NPV.R"))
source(here::here("R", "compute_profit_from_power.R"))

compute_profit_from_power

compute_NPV
```


```{r valuep}
# use solar from  site1 from above as input
head(annual_elect)

profit_solar = compute_profit_frompower(energy=annual_elect$elect,
                                        year=annual_elect$year,
                                        price=30, discount=0.04)

head(profit_solar)

ggplot(profit_solar, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+
  labs(y="Profit in current $", x="Year")

```

# Putting it all together

now lets add both of our functions (hydro and solar power), together with computing profit and sensitivity analysis to create a full picture of power options


Notice that we can 're-use' our functions such as **compute_profit_frompower** for both sources of power
(such as our reservoir power model) to build out our complete model

```{r reuse}
# rerun 'sampling' in using_data_with_functions.Rmd. above to get results from our reserovir model

# lets start with hydro power
source(here::here("R", "power_gen.R"))
```


```{r reuse}
# we are 'making up' inputs for hydro power - to have it match the number of year 
# that we had solar values for, lets sets the number of runs equal to the number of years

number_years = length(profit_solar$year)

reservoir_model_res= as.data.frame(matrix(nrow=number_years, ncol=3))

colnames(reservoir_model_res)=c("height","flow","power")
```


```{r reuse}
# Step 2 - generate heights and flow rates
reservoir_model_res$height = rnorm(mean=10, sd=1, n=number_years)

reservoir_model_res$flow = runif(min=0.1, max=1, n=number_years)
```


```{r reuse}
# Step 3 - generate uncertainty due to reservoir efficiency, lets assume that 
# we know its somewhere between 0.4 and 0.7
par1 = runif(min=0.4, max=0.7, n=20)
```


```{r reuse}
# Step 4 - apply model to get power for each height, flow rate (each year), across
# uncertainty in efficiency
reservoir = Keff %>% map_dfc(~power_gen(
  height=reservoir_model_res$height, 
  flow=reservoir_model_res$flow, Keff=.x) ) 
#.x = what is coming through the pipe 
#we want to use what is coming through the pipe for the Keff parameter 

colnames(reservoir)=Keff

head(reservoir)
```


```{r reuse}
# add years - remember we are making up data for the same years that we have solar
reservoir$year = profit_solar$year

# reorganize for easier analysis 
reservoirg=as.data.frame(reservoir) %>% pivot_longer(!year,names_to="Keff", values_to="power")
head(reservoirg)

# create profit from hydro
profit_hydro = compute_profit_frompower(energy=reservoirg$power, year= reservoirg$year, price=30, discount=0.04)

names(profit_hydro)
```


```{r reuse}
# plot
ggplot(profit_hydro, aes(as.factor(year), netpre, group=year))+geom_boxplot()+labs(y="Net Present Value of Power in 1945 Dollars", x="Year")
```

#it looks like solar is going to be more profitable 
#we have accounted for parameter uncertainty (efficiency uncertainty), and solar is still going to be more profitable
